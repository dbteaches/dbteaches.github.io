							<h2>Teaching</h2>
							<p>I began teaching college at Clemson in 2007, and when many of my colleagues were going into corporate technical communication careers, I stayed in academia. I found that my passion for effective communication translated neatly into academic contexts. My students were my users, and a “you-orientation” served me well as a young instructor. I found resonances between course and curriculum design and professional communication. As professional and technical communication has merged more and more with instructional design, I have continued to develop my skills in the instructional design and technology areas.

My teaching focuses on developing confident, versatile writers through active pedagogies, critical reflection, and transparent assessment and response practices, grounded in strong relationships with students.</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>I wrote my dissertation about the use of music in the college writing classroom because I wanted to know how writing teachers were using another mode (aural, especially music) to inform the teaching of the linguistic mode. But my takeaways really involve pedagogy: I found that the use of music in the writing classroom is a way of extending academic hospitality, of welcoming students into a liminal space between familiar and unfamiliar expectations.

My research centers on the intersections of multimodality, pedagogy, and digital writing, with special attention to ethics and professional communication. Fun fact: I wrote the Wikipedia entry for rhetorical circulation.</p>

							<h2>Experience</h2>
							<p>My professional experience outside of teaching has been largely in the areas of administration of writing and multiliteracies centers, and in editing, both in the popular and academic markets, but I have also done pro-bono work for some nonprofits, including designing websites, writing press releases, and serving on the Board of Trustees of a local nonprofit, the Alabama Blues Project. My service experience has been varied, including such activities as mentoring undergraduate students and scoring grants for the State of Alabama Department of Education.</p>
