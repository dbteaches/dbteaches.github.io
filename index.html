							<h2>Teaching</h2>
							<p>I began teaching college at Clemson in 2007, and when many of my colleagues were going into corporate technical communication careers, I stayed in academia. I found that my passion for effective communication translated neatly into academic contexts. My students were my users, and a “you-orientation” served me well as a young instructor. I found resonances between course and curriculum design and professional communication.

My teaching focuses on developing confident, versatile writers through active pedagogies, critical reflection, and transparent assessment and response practices, grounded in strong relationships with students.</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>I wrote my dissertation about the use of music in the college writing classroom because I wanted to know how writing teachers were using another mode (aural, especially music) to inform the teaching of the linguistic mode. But my takeaways really involve pedagogy: I found that the use of music in the writing classroom is a way of extending academic hospitality, of welcoming students into a liminal space between familiar and unfamiliar expectations.

My research centers on the intersections of multimodality, pedagogy, and digital writing, with special attention to ethics and professional communication.</p>

							<h2>Creative</h2>
							<p>My two great loves are music and writing, and if I’m not teaching, I’m probably writing something or playing a musical instrument of some sort. I also write songs. I’ve had the honor participating in the Black Warrior Songwriters Festival for the last two years, and I occasionally play open mics or solo gigs.</p>
